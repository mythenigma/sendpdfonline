      <p>This page is the <strong>MaiPDF</strong> online "PDF → Image" conversion tool. You can upload any PDF, choose different output formats, and turn your file into a "view-only, hard-to-edit" image-based document. All operations are completed in your browser, no software installation required.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Four Output Options</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Images in ZIP:</strong> Convert each page into a separate image and package them into a ZIP file, suitable for download or website upload.</li>
        <li><strong>Imaginized PDF:</strong> Package the entire file as an "image-based PDF"—layout preserved, but direct editing is disabled.</li>
        <li><strong>Imaginized PDF with Print:</strong> Same as above, but only printing is allowed; copying and editing are disabled.</li>
        <li><strong>PDF in All Restrictions:</strong> Generate a super-restricted PDF where all operations (copy, print, edit) are disabled.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Optional "Compression" Switch</h2>
