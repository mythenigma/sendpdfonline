    <p>Key selling point in one sentence: Package PDFs into local HTML, store on USB drives or NAS – each opening requires lightning-fast authorization from the server, ensuring confidentiality and revocability.</p>

    <h2>1 | Why Choose "Offline Storage + Online Authorization" Mode?</h2>

    <h2>2 | 4 Core Features of the Offline Version</h2>
    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
    <p>PDFs are encapsulated into a single HTML, easily copied to USB drives / private NAS.</p>

    <h3>Online Verification</h3>
    <p>Background-level handshake upon opening: verifies reading code, remaining uses, expiration date. Disconnection → direct refusal to launch.</p>

    <h3>Read Code / Encode Dual Channel</h3>
    <p>Read Code: View only; Encode: Replace files, add uses. Retain a "regret button" while sharing files.</p>

    <h3>Access Tracking</h3>
    <p>Each verification request records IP, time, clear at a glance in the background – who has viewed, when it ended, one-click export to CSV.</p>

    <h2>3 | Typical Use Cases</h2>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Industry / Occasion</th>
                <th>Specific Use</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Hardware Manufacturing Delivery</td>
                <td>Package blueprints into HTML to accompany equipment on-site; customer's computer has no internet? Bring your own portable Wi-Fi router to emit a one-time hotspot for verification.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Legal and Auditing</td>
                <td>Lawyers submit due diligence materials, limit to 5 uses with reading code; after the audit, "terminate authorization" with one click in the background using encoding.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Exhibition / Training</td>
                <td>Distribute product white papers via USB drive, automatically cache pages after initial verification, can still browse offline for 24 hours after leaving the exhibition hall.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>University Research</td>
                <td>Internally exchange draft papers, files remain on the school's server; external collaborators can scan the QR code for temporary verification to view.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>4 | 3 Steps to Generate Encrypted HTML</h2>
    <p>Upload PDF → Complete encapsulation within 30 seconds.</p>

    <h3>Set Permissions</h3>
    <p>Number of views, expiration date, whether to lock IP / region.</p>

    <h3>Download Offline Package</h3>
    <p>Get Project_X_Spec.html + simultaneously generate access/edit codes & QR code.</p>

    <p>Tips: Write the version number clearly in the file name to facilitate the other party's browser tab display and reduce misreading.</p>

    <h2>5 | Add Another Layer of Security Awareness</h2>
    <p>Non-Printable / Disable Copying: Browser-level disabling of print menus, right-click, and shortcuts.</p>

    <p>Dynamic Watermark: Automatically overlays date + IP when opened, screenshots can also trace the source.</p>

    <p>HTTPS Verification Channel: Authorization handshake uses an encrypted channel to prevent man-in-the-middle tampering.</p>

    <p>One-Time Reading Mode: Deduct uses upon opening, invalidates when the window is closed, preventing screenshots and background streaming.</p>

            <tr>
                <td>Cost</td>
                <td>Personal & small team version is permanently free; ultra-high concurrency can be upgraded to a paid plan (billed by verification count, almost 1% of the cost of traditional DRM).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Deployment</td>
                <td>No server or local software required; the browser is the reader.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Update</td>
                <td>If there are new features, re-upload the original PDF to get the new version of HTML; the old package is not affected.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
