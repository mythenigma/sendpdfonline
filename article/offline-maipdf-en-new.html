        <h2>Why Choose "Offline Storage + Online Authorization"?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Traditional Cloud Storage:</strong> Data stays with third parties, high compliance pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Pure Local Encryption:</strong> Once sent, it's out of control, cannot be revoked.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional DRM Platforms:</strong> Complex deployment, high costs.</li>
        </ul>
